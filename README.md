# YouTube Comment Scraper üöÄ

This project is a simple **JavaScript script that automatically scrolls through and collects all comments** on a YouTube video page.  
It‚Äôs designed to be run directly in the browser console to automate manual tasks.

---

## üß† How It Works

The script operates in three main steps:

1. **Auto Scroll (`otomatikKaydir`)**  
   Automatically scrolls to the bottom of the page  
   until no new comments are loaded.

2. **Comment Collection (`yorumlariTopla`)**  
   Finds all comment elements (`ytd-comment-thread-renderer`)  
   and extracts the author name and comment text.

3. **Main Function (`baslat`)**  
   Waits for all comments to load,  
   then prints them to the console in both **list** and **table** formats.
